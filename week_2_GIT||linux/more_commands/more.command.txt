Undoing Changes---
Case 1: staged changes
git reset <- file name >
git reset
Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1
Git log // for seeing commits
Case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
git reset <- commit hash >
git reset --hard <- commit hash
		○ when using command git reset --hard <hash>
        make sure u are absolutely sure as it will be permanent



Git pull---
Git pull-- for getting from remote repo(git fetch and git merge)
Git pull --rebase as u know the work of rebase is that is too make the history in same line 
incase u want more control
	• git fetch // (to get the latest remote changes)
git rebase origin/<branch_name>




what I have learned about getting a new connection in git hub in different os
	• Mac os
		○ when first time you config the git hub in mac os it simply ask for password and store in key access app of the mac os
		○ and when next time you use git push it uses that to authenticate the user
		○ the service is called osxkeychain
		○ 
		○ it helps in verifying the identity of the user to github
		○ now In linux key chain access is not present so there is some thing else in place ofc
	• in linux
		○ when first time setting it up it asks for password
		○ but as of right now the password has been disabled for authentication as git hub sees them as less secure
		○ so there are other methods in place for this authentication to happen
		○ one of the things I used when setting up was used git config command
		○ 
		○ Then when I tried to push it it stopped me saying this
		○ .
		○ 
		○ now what I could have used many thing such ssh,PAT etc but I used (PAT) Personal access tokens
		○ for setting this up
			§ go to github
			§ go to settings
			§ go to developer settings
			§ go to PAT
			§ click on generate new token
				□ enter the name of the tokens and permission u wanna give
				□ then create the token 
				□ copy the token as you will only be able to do it once
				□ now
		○ instead of password when it. ask for password now just give it the PAT
		○ now its almost done just so it doesn't ask you every time u push/pull 
		○ 
		○ use this command and it will save it 
			§ git config --global credential.helper cache
		○ if u wanna unset it
		○ 
	• windows
		○ After installing git bash you can just go ahead 
		○ and run the commands usual like in linux 
		○ using PAT you should be able to push the things
